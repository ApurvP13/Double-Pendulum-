### Double-Pendulum Simulation 
 <hr>

<p>Double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic. </p>

### <h2>Implementation</h2>

I used python and [The Processesing](https://processing.org/)'s software to implement the simulation. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzPe_S-RVE) by The Coding Train helped a lot, although he implemented the simulation in Java, but I did some code translation to implement it in Python.
